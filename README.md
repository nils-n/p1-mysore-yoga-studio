# MYSORE YOGA STUDIO 

This website targets members of an imaginary Yoga studio based in Glasgow, UK. The purpose of the studio is to provide a space where students can find relaxation and mindfulness outisde their stressful and competitive day-to-day life. The website encourages people to sign up for Yoga who have never practised Yoga before, and it provides basic information for Yoga students that are already signed up.

    <li>I want to keep my current customers happy and help them progress in Yoga </li>
    <li> I want to encourage current users to to enroll in additional classes</li>
    <li>I want to expand the studio so that I can hire new teachers and add new Yoga classes </li>
</ol>


### Website Aims

- Provide all required information. 
- Motivate to join and stay subscribed. 
- Provide ways to contact the studio. 
- add to overall positive experience also outside the class. 

### How these needs are addressed

- All possible user scenarios and potential needs were identified and documented. 
- The user needs to feel instantly a positive emotion and should know instantly what to expect from this website. 
- This is very important because users interested in Yoga usually try to reduce their stress - and dealing with a poorly designed website would be in contrast to the experience that they look for.  
- Contact information of various channels will be provided, i.e. via Telephone/Email and Links to Facebook/Instagram channels.

### Opportunities 

| Description                    | Impact | Feasibility       | 
|--------------------------------|--------|-------------------|
| Inform about Studio Ethos      | 5      | 5                 | 
| Inform about Location          | 5      | 5                 | 
| Inform about Schedule          | 5      | 5                 | 
| Recruit new members            | 5      | 5                 | 
| Keep current members           | 5      | 5                 | 
| ~~Send reminders and updates~~ | 4      | 1                 | 
| **Sum**                          | **25**   | **25**         | 


### Feature selection

The sum of Impact/Feasibility is balanced after discarding the entry "Send reminders and updates". This had to be discarded because it is currently not feasible with my current knowledge of CSS/HTML in the targeted time frame. This feature would be addressed in a future release when I have advanced in the class.

## Design

### Color Scheme

A harmonic color scheme was chosen in order to match the theme of a mindful-centered website. Warm, earth tones were chosen to create a warm, comforting atmosphere. In addition, a small set of lively colors add a contrast to the earthly tones in order to make the page more lively and vital - also to express the studio's message of a balanced life style. 

All color tones have been taken using a color picker from the hero image using the color palette generator [Link to Acknowledgements](#acknowledgements).

     alt="Image with Hex codes for the colors used on this website. It consists of five earhtly, warm Colors and 4 more lively, contrasting colors of the logo."
     style="padding:16px; width:50%" >
</p>

### Typography

Fonts were selected to create a professional, classic and smooth impression. Balanced contrast was selected to create a harmony that is in line with the site's goal of a relaxed and mindful work-life balance. Font pairs were then generated using deep learning-based approach using [Fontjoy](https://fontjoy.com/). In the final website, fonts were imported via [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
- Lato (Light 300) was chosen for the Heading (H1)
- Montserrat Alternates (Medium 500) was chosen for the body text on the site
- Oswald (Regular 400) was chosen for Headings h2-h6


### Imagery 

###  Prototype of the Page using Wireframes


Wireframes were generated using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) for mobile and desktop displays using a mobile-first approach.  

[Wireframe for the Homepage](/assets/documentation/page1-home.png)

[Wireframe for the Classes Page](assets/documentation/page2-classes.png)

[Wireframe for the Signup Page](assets/documentation/page3-signup.png)

###  Layout and Refinement of the Wireframe using Figma 

The layout of the page was then refined using [Figma](https://figma.com/). The layout was created both for mobile and desktop displays, with a mobile-first approach.

 During this refinement phase, it has turned out that it would be best to separate the Yoga schedule from the class description page and separate the schedule information from the Classes page and create a new page for it.

## Features 

### General Features 

The website consits of a home page, a classes pages, a schedule page and a signup page. Each page has a Favicon icon in the browser tab, a navigation bar and a footer. All Pages are responsive. 

-------
### Main Page 

#### Navigation Bar

<p align="center">

     alt="Image with view of navigation bar"
     style="max-width:800px" >
</p>

#### Hero Image

- The first CTA encourage the new users to sign upfor a free trial class
- The second CTA directs to the Classes Page 
- The buttons are placed on top of an image of a Yoga student in a relaxing pose 

<p align="center">

     alt="Image with view of hero image"
     style="max-width:800px" >
</p>

#### Welcome Message

     alt="Image with view of the main welcome message"
     style="max-width:800px" >
</p>

#### Classes Overview Section
- A section with an overview of the offered classes including time information, and teacher name. 
- Each class can be clicked on and the user gets directed to the classes page

<p align="center">
<img src="assets/documentation/feature-classes.png"
     alt="Image with view of hero image"
     style="max-width:800px" >
</p>

#### Prices Section
- This one was difficult to design : On one hand, Yoga is meant to be non-materialistic and money should not play a major role. But on the other hand, the user is very much interested in this information! 
- A solution to this problem was to create contrasting, playful and colorful section that is nice to look at while still being part of the Main Page

<p align="center">
<img src="assets/documentation/feature-pricing.png"
     alt="Image with view of prices section"
     style="max-width:800px" >
</p>

#### Contact Section 
- This section conveys the location by embedding a google maps location and writing the actual address, and a telephone number 
- Another CTA is embedded to further encourage the user to sign up for a free trial 

<p align="center">
<img src="assets/documentation/feature-contact.png"
     alt="Image with view of contact section"
     style="max-width:800px" >
</p>

#### Footer Section

- The footer contains links to Facebook, Instagram , Twitter and a copyright message
- Since the Yoga studio does not exist, these link open the main page of Facebook, etc.
- The style of the footer is minimal, and the links are icons within a circle 

<p align="center">
<img src="assets/documentation/feature-footer.png"
     alt="Image with view of footer section"
     style="max-width:800px" >
</p>

-------

#### Yoga Classes Page

- Each Class is within a colored box and contains information such A Summary of the Techniques, Difficulty Level, Teacher Name and Time of the Class
- As a feature, each Class is associated with a color. 
- When the user navigate from this page to the Schedule Page, they will find the same colors of the class in the Week Schedule guiding them visually to the information they want

<p align="center">
<img src="assets/documentation/feature-class-page.png"
     alt="Image with view of Yoga Class Page"
     style="max-width:800px" >
</p>

-------

#### Schedule Page 

- This page contains the Weekly Yoga Schedule from Monday to Friday, including information about Begin and End of Class, and the Teacher 
- The classes are additionally couloured using the same colour of the Classes Page to help users visually to find the information they are looking for (when a particular class happens)
- On large screens, this information is displayed as Schedule Grid, on mobile screen the grid gets stacked to account for smaller screen size 

<p align="center">
<img src="assets/documentation/feature-schedule.png"
     alt="Image with view of Class Schedule Page"
     style="max-width:800px" >
</p>
