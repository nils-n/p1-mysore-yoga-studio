# MYSORE YOGA STUDIO 

This website targets members of an imaginary Yoga studio based in Glasgow, UK. The purpose of the studio is to provide a space where students can find relaxation and mindfulness outisde their stressful and competitive day-to-day life. The website encourages people to sign up for Yoga who have never practised Yoga before, and it provides basic information for Yoga students that are already signed up.

</ol>


### Website Aims

- Provide all required information. 
- Motivate to join and stay subscribed. 
- Provide ways to contact the studio. 
- add to overall positive experience also outside the class. 

### How these needs are addressed

- All possible user scenarios and potential needs were identified and documented. 
- The user needs to feel instantly a positive emotion and should know instantly what to expect from this website. 
- This is very important because users interested in Yoga usually try to reduce their stress - and dealing with a poorly designed website would be in contrast to the experience that they look for.  
- Contact information of various channels will be provided, i.e. via Telephone/Email and Links to Facebook/Instagram channels.

### Opportunities 

| Description                    | Impact | Feasibility       | 
|--------------------------------|--------|-------------------|
| Inform about Studio Ethos      | 5      | 5                 | 
| Inform about Location          | 5      | 5                 | 
| Inform about Schedule          | 5      | 5                 | 
| Recruit new members            | 5      | 5                 | 
| Keep current members           | 5      | 5                 | 
| ~~Send reminders and updates~~ | 4      | 1                 | 
| **Sum**                          | **25**   | **25**         | 


### Feature selection

The sum of Impact/Feasibility is balanced after discarding the entry "Send reminders and updates". This had to be discarded because it is currently not feasible with my current knowledge of CSS/HTML in the targeted time frame. This feature would be addressed in a future release when I have advanced in the class.

## Design

### Color Scheme

A harmonic color scheme was chosen in order to match the expectation of a mindful-themed website. Warm, earth tones were chosen to create a warm, comforting atmosphere. The basic tone was taken using a color picker from the hero image using the color palette generator [Link to Acknowledgements](#acknowledgements)

     alt="Image with five Colors and Hex codes for the colors used on this website"
     style="padding:16px" >

### Typography

Fonts were selected to create a professional, classic and smooth impression. Balanced contrast was selected to create a harmony that is in line with the site's goal of a relaxed and mindful work-life balance. Font pairs were then generated using deep learning-based approach using [Fontjoy](https://fontjoy.com/). In the final website, fonts were imported via [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
- Lato (Light 300) was chosen for the Heading (H1)
- Montserrat Alternates (Medium 500) was chosen for the body text on the site
- Oswald (Regular 400) was chosen for Headings h2-h6


### Imagery
